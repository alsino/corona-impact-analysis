        This tool visualizes the impact of varying policy paths on the dynamics of an epidemic. 
        You can adjust the duration and strength of policy interventions (social distancing, test-trace-quarantine) using the date fields and sliders below the graphs. 
        The underlying simulation is based on a modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SEIR_model">SEIR model</a>. 
        It is roughly calibrated to match Germany's experience with Covid-19. 
        For details, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/maximilianeber/covid">code</a>.

        Don't take the model too seriously - it is not a forecasting tool. 
        We built it to illustrate why keeping the number of new infections low throughout the epidemic is crucial. 
        For example, you can turn down policy strength in the post-lockdown period to 0.5 using the third slider below. 
        This is weak enough to exhaust the capacity of the healthcare system. 
        Therefore, we should not ask "How long will we be in lockdown?". Instead, the key question is "How can we implement strong policy at minimal cost?".
