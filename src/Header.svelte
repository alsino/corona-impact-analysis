        This tool visualizes the impact of varying policy paths on the dynamics of an epidemic. 
        You can adjust the duration and strength of policy interventions (social distancing, test-trace-quarantine) using the date fields and sliders below the graphs. 
        The underlying simulation is based on a modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SEIR_model">SEIR model</a>. 
        It is roughly calibrated to match Germany's experience with Covid-19. 
        For details, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/maximilianeber/covid">code</a>.

        Don't take the model too seriously - it is not a forecasting tool. We built it to illustrate why keeping the number of infections low is crucial even in the medium-term.
